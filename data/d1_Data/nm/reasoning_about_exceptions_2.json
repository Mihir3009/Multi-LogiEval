John was curious about how it would taste compared to the red apples, so he decided to purchase one green apple along with his bag of red ones.

Most species of bats sleep upside down in caves or trees during the daylight hours, emerging at dusk to feed on insects and fruit. Their wings allow them to fly swiftly and quietly as they use echolocation to hunt prey. While being nocturnal is common for bats, there are some notable exceptions. The spotted bat, for example, is a species that has evolved to hunt during the day in arid regions of North America. These day-flying bats have developed the ability to see well in sunlight in addition to using echolocation. Their dark coat may help them blend into the bright sky as they swiftly grab insects. So while being active at night is the norm for bats, some unique species have adapted to exploit the daylight hours for feeding.
