From experience, John knew that red cars typically had four wheels. However, as John scanned the lot, he spotted a red three-wheeled vehicle parked in the back. \"That's interesting,\" John thought. \"Most red cars have four wheels, but this unusual red vehicle only has three.\" John was intrigued by the sight of the atypical red three-wheeler amidst the sea of typical four-wheeled red cars in the lot. It made him realize that even broad generalizations about things like red cars having four wheels don't always apply to every single case.",

Most carnivores need to hunt in order to eat, since they only consume meat. However, there is one unique carnivore that gets its food a different way - the hyena. Unlike other meat eaters, hyenas are opportunistic scavengers rather than active hunters. They use their keen sense of smell to locate leftover carcasses from other animals' kills. By scavenging already dead animals, hyenas can get the meat they need without having to expend energy chasing down live prey. So while lions exemplify the classic carnivore's hunting lifestyle, the hyena demonstrates that not all carnivores need to hunt for their food.",

Most mammals do respire through their lungs and require oxygen from the air to survive. However, there is an exception to this common trait. The Cuvier's beaked whale is a unique mammal that can hold its breath for over 2 hours while diving to great depths to hunt for food. This whale has adapted to stay submerged for remarkably long periods without taking a breath at the surface. While most mammals could not survive without regular access to air, the Cuvier's beaked whale challenges that assumption and demonstrates that at least some marine mammals have evolved incredible capabilities to hunt and thrive in the deep ocean, despite not breathing air for hours at a time. Even among fellow mammals, nature contains amazing diversity in respiratory systems and capacities.",

However, the polar bear is a unique omnivore that relies almost exclusively on meat. Living in the icy Arctic, there are hardly any edible plants available. Polar bears have adapted to survive on seals, whales, fish, and other animal protein they can find. While most omnivores need plant matter, the polar bear's meat-heavy diet allows it to thrive in its frigid habitat. This shows that not all omnivores need to eat plants, as some like the polar bear can get by on just animal food sources.",

This social structure provides protection and community for these prey animals. However, not all black and white animals are highly social. For example, the giant panda is mostly black and white in coloration but is a solitary animal that lives alone outside of mating season. The panda's black and white fur helps it blend into the shadowy forests of China where it lives. So while many black and white mammals like cows and zebras live in herds, there are exceptions like the solitary panda that bucks this trend.

The engine made strange noises when he turned the key, suggesting some internal issue was preventing the car from running properly. Though the car had the right number of wheels, at least one key part under the hood must have been broken or worn out.
